## Git Workflow Summary
- **Repository Setup:**  
  - One member creates the central repository.  
  - All members clone the repo: `git clone <repository_url>`  
  - Create a `develop` branch from `main`: `git checkout -b develop`  

- **Task Division:**  
  - Each member works on a specific feature in their own branch:  
    - Student 1: Add new books  
    - Student 2: Edit/remove books  
    - Student 3: Browse/view catalog  
    - Student 4: Search books  
    - Student 5: Borrow/return books  

- **Branching & Development:**  
  - Update local `develop`: `git pull origin develop`  
  - Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/<feature_name>`  
  - Stage & commit changes:  
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Description of changes"
    git push origin feature/<feature_name>
    ```  

- **Merging & Collaboration:**  
  - Create a Pull Request to merge feature branch into `develop`.  
  - Other members review before merging.  
  - Delete feature branch after merge.  

- **Finalization:**  
  - Merge `develop` into `main` for the production-ready version.
